# PID-Servo-controller---Embedded-Systems-
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system using an Arduino, a servo motor, and a potentiometer. The servo motor smoothly follows the target angle set by the potentiometer using a PID loop for accurate and stable control.
